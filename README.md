Custom Plate Images For Vehicles

What Does This Do?
=

Well, simply put; you can change the background image for license plates! Once upon a time you were able to stream the `vehshare.ytd` file to do this, however this is no longer possible. 

This method uses a FiveM Native function to replace the texture via script.


How Do I Change The Plate Background To A Custom Image?
=

It's pretty simple

1. Use the template files provided below (Ensure the size has a ratio equivalent to that of `600x350`) `1200x700` is possibly your best bet.
2. Customize the plate to your liking and save the file as a `.png`
3. upload the plate to an image website (I personally use [Imgur](https://imgur.com))
4. Get the raw image file URL (URL should end with a `.png`)
5. Paste your URL into the `plates.lua`

Plates significations
=

  Plate 1 = Plate Blue on White 2
  Plate 2 = Plate Yellow on Black
  Plate 3 = Plate Yellow on Blue
  Plate 4 = Plate Blue on White 1
  Plate 5 = Plate Blue on White 3 (SA EXEMPT)
  Plate 6 = North Yankton

Possibly Important Stuff

First off, here are the template files
- Help Image  [Raw](https://i.imgur.com/30nUtFe.png) -- This is just an image to show where the license text will appear
- Empty Template | [Raw](https://i.imgur.com/g5uQHfo.png) -- The actual empty license plate image

- [.PDN] Template -- For those who use `Paint.NET`: this is the only file you'll need

**Other Notes**

Without configuration, this script will give in-game license plates a texture glitch
*I will not be providing assistance with the creation of textures for the plates*
